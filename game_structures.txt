# How to read this document:
#    Names that are in PascalCase (aka TitleCase) are classes
#    Names that are in camelCase are class properties
#    Names that are in camelCase followed by a pair of parentheses--i.e., camelCase()--are class methods
#
# Also, as in Python, indentation counts! :)
# Anything that is indented is a property / method / class of the previous level.
#
# Any changes made to this document should reflect these conventions
